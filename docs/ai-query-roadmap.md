# AI-Powered Historical Data Query System Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the implementation of an AI query layer for the application, allowing users to retrieve insights from their historical health and activity data through natural language queries.

## Phase 1: Data Collection & Storage

### Structured Data Schema
- Design a comprehensive schema for all user data (medications, appointments, activities)
- Include proper timestamps and versioning for historical tracking
- Implement data categorization for efficient retrieval

### Persistent Storage Solution
- Set up a secure database with proper encryption for sensitive health data
- Implement regular backups and data integrity checks
- Create a data retention policy compliant with healthcare regulations

### Data Export/Import
- Add functionality to export/import data in standard formats (JSON, CSV)
- Support integration with common health tracking platforms
- Design synchronization mechanisms for multi-device usage

## Phase 2: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Infrastructure

### Vector Database Integration
- Implement a vector database (like Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus)
- Create embedding pipeline for user data
- Design efficient indexing strategy for quick retrieval

### Embedding System
- Select appropriate embedding model for healthcare/personal data
- Build preprocessing pipeline for various data types
- Implement incremental embedding updates for new data

### Query Processing
- Design natural language query parser
- Implement semantic search capabilities
- Create fallback mechanisms for ambiguous queries

## Phase 3: AI Assistant Implementation

### AI Model Integration
- Integrate with an LLM API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Fine-tune prompt templates for healthcare/personal data context
- Implement result validation and fact-checking mechanisms

### Context-Aware Responses
- Develop system to maintain conversation history
- Create user preference learning for personalized responses
- Implement time-aware query processing ("a year ago", "last summer")

### Privacy & Security Layer
- Implement strong authentication for AI queries
- Create data access controls and audit logs
- Design system to minimize sensitive data exposure

## Phase 4: User Experience

### Natural Language Interface
- Design conversational UI for queries
- Implement speech-to-text for accessibility
- Support multi-modal inputs (text, voice, images)

### Results Visualization
- Create visual timelines for historical data
- Implement charts and graphs for trends
- Design printable/shareable reports

### Suggested Queries
- Implement smart suggestions based on user data
- Create templates for common healthcare queries
- Design guided query builder for complex questions

## Sample Use Cases

The system should support natural language queries such as:

1. "What medications was I taking last January?"
2. "When did I switch from Lisinopril to Metoprolol?"
3. "Show me all my doctor appointments from 2023"
4. "Have I had any adverse reactions to my arthritis medication?"
5. "When was the last time I reported feeling dizzy?"
6. "What was my routine when I was feeling my best?"

## Technical Considerations

- Focus on edge computing for privacy (process data locally when possible)
- Implement proper consent management for AI analysis
- Design with HIPAA compliance in mind
- Create clear explanations of how AI uses and interprets personal data
- Build with extensibility for future health device integrations (smartwatches, blood pressure monitors, etc.)

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1:** 2-3 months
- **Phase 2:** 3-4 months
- **Phase 3:** 2-3 months
- **Phase 4:** 2-3 months

Total estimated timeline: 9-13 months, with opportunity for incremental feature releases throughout the development process.
